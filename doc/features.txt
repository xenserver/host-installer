Features flags
==============

Some host-installer features are not enabled by default, and
downstream installers can activate them by creating a file in
/etc/xensource/features/ in their installer filesystem.

Currently available feature flags are:

  supplemental-packs

    Support installation of supplemental packs after installation of
    the main product.

    This only impacts the UI, the <source> answerfile construct still
    allows to include supplemental packs without this feature flag.

    This also has no impact if users previously load a driver disk:
    they will get the opportunity to insert it again to get the driver
    installed on the host.

  large-block-capable-sr-type

    Allow the use of an SR type for local storage that (unlike "lvm" and
    "ext") is not restricted to using disks with 512 byte blocks. The flag
    file's content must be the name of the SR type.

    The other expectations for such an SR type are:
    - Its only non-optional creation parameter (as with "lvm" and "ext") is
      "device", a comma-separated list devices to use.
    - It should use an identifying prefix for the names of volume groups that
      it creates, and this prefix should start "XSLocal". (e.g. if the SR type
      were called "foo", it might use the prefix "XSLocalFOO".)

Commandline Parameters
======================

In what follows, "Startup" parameters are the kernel boot parameters.
They are either interpreted by the Linux kernel itself, or by the `preinit` script
which is in charge of starting the installer program itself.

"Installer" parameters are the parameters that the installer itself accepts.
To pass such parameters from the boot command line, remove the prefixing dashes.
Example: to pass the `--extrarepo=repo*` parameter to the installer, add it as
the following kernel command line parameter: `extrarepo=repo*`.

All parameters are optional unless otherwise specified.

When passing a script or answerfile, a URL is expected unless otherwise
specified. For scripts available locally to the installer, use a `file://`
prefix.

Scripts are expected to begin with a shebang, with the following as accepted
interpreters:
  /bin/sh
  /bin/bash
  /usr/bin/python


Startup
-------

  debug

    Enable additional debugging info including kernel messages.


  blacklist=module[,module2]*

    Prevent PCI aliases for a module causing it to be loaded by udev.


  enable-ide

    Removes blacklist of IDE subsystem drivers.


  blacklist-ide[D]

    Default in 6.0, use enable-ide to reverse.


  extramodules=module[,module2]*

    Load supplied modules.


  make-ramdisk=dev

    Create a ramdisk of sufficient size on /tmp/ramdisk and copy the contents
    of the device into it. Multiple instances may be given but only the first to
    succeed will be mounted.

    If the filesystem on the device contains a top level directory named
    "xsinst" then the ramdisk will be populated with the unpacked contents of
    any *.iso file in xsinst.

    If the ISO is a XenServer install ISO (i.e. contains a .treeinfo file), its
    contents will be copied to the top level of the filesystem in the ramdisk.

    Any other ISOs will be copied to the a directory named after the ISO file,
    (e.g. test1.iso will be extracted to test1/).

    Any non-ISO files/dirs in xsinst get copied to the top level of the
    filesystem in the ramdisk. Any files/dirs outside of the "xsinst" directory
    will be ignored.


  xsinst=path

    When using make-ramdisk with the "xsinst" support described above, this
    parameter can be used to override the expected directory name. Note that
    this parameter *must* preceed make-ramdisk on the command line.


  mount=dev[:fstype[:opt]]:mnt

    Mount a given device on a mountpoint. dev can also be a logical
    volume in the local SR or filesystem label (prefixed with LABEL=).


  start=exe

    Start exe rather than the installer (new in 6.0)


  console=con

    Run an instance of the installer on con.


  term=termtype

    set TERM.


  bash-shell|shell

   Start a shell before running the installer.


  atexit=reboot|poweroff|shell

    Action to perform when installer exits. (new in 6.1)

      reboot - reboot system

      poweroff - power off system

      shell - drop to shell

    Default: reboot


  sshpassword=<password>

    Start an ssh server with the root password set as requested.


Installer
---------

  --answerfile=url

    Read answerfile and perform a non-interactive installation
    reporting status using screens.


  --rt_answerfile=url

    Read answerfile and perform a non-interactive installation
    reporting status to the console as text.


  --answerfile_generator=url

    Retrieve script, run it and use the output of it as an answerfile.


  --network_device=eth|mac|all
  --answerfile_device[D]=...

    Bring up networking on the given interface to allow access to
    answerfiles.

    Default: "all" if a non-local URL is specified for any of the above
    answerfile parameters, else no device is started

    --answerfile_device is a deprecated alias, and accepts the same
      parameters as --network_device.


  --map_netdev=eth:d|s:mac|pci[[index]]|ppn

    Map interface with the given MAC address, PCI address or PPN to the given
    interface name.
    Some NICs expose multiple interfaces for a single PCI address.  In these
    cases the PPN is often not reliable.  An index to a PCI address can be
    specified if required (NICs are sorted in MAC order).  An index of 0 is
    implied when one is not provided.


  --network_config=dhcp[:vlan=vlan]|static:ip=ip;netmask=netmask[;gateway=gw][;dns=dns1[,dns2]][;domain=domain][;vlan=vlan]

    Defines the IP configuration to bring up to allow access to
    answerfiles. VLAN is supported from 1 to 4094.

    Default: dhcp


  --reboot

    Reboot host after installation


  --device_mapper_multipath=disabled|enabled

    Default: disabled


  --use_ibft

    Read IBFT to determine iSCSI boot configuration.


  --boot_console=con

    Use con as the console for XenServer rather than that specified by
    --console.


  --keymap=kbd

    Specifies the console keymap.

    Default: us


  --extrarepo=repo*

    Install repo in addition to repositories defined by answerfile
    etc.


  --onecd

    Do not prompt for additional media.

  --virtual

    Installer is running in a VM.


  --disable-uefi

    Install in legacy boot mode. Only present in 7.0.


  --cc-preparations

    Prepare configuration for common criteria security.
